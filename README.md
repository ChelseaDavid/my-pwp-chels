# Milestone 1
## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the required specifications laid out in the documentation. The HTML is impeccable and the directory structure matches what was outlined. your content is straight foreword and i am easily able to tell who your target demographic is.
## Feedback
What you hope to accomplish with your PWP should be straight foreword and relatively easy to achieve. The hardest part will be making the site stream lined so your ideal user can easily tell if your qualified.

# Milestone 2a
## Overall Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone2a. Directory structure, Html, and content are superb. This is the quality of work I would expect out of a jr developer working underneath me. I am a little disappointed in your git history. For Milestone2a you only have three commits with the same message. I know Milestone2a is a little weird because you are creating images outside of PHPStorm, but I still want to see normal github hygiene with unique commit messages for each commit. The road map you laid out for yourself in Milestone2a will be extremely beneficial when you start development.
### Wireframes
Your Wireframes are clear and easy to understand. With a quick glance I am able to tell what you hope to accomplish and have a clear vision of what your website will look like. The Mobile and Desktop wireframes match and are clearly of the same site(which should translate nicely bootstrap4).
### Content Strategy
The Content Strategy is clear and complements your wireframes nicely. You went extremely in-depth with your content strategy which appreciate because it gives me a clear picture of what you hope to accomplish.
## Design Tips
Because your site is not relying on interactivity I challenge you to make your website as clean and polished as possible with solid a color scheme and typography. (remember simple/clean is harder to accomplish than overly-complicated/bloated)

## Moving Foreword
We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Please use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory from here out!
