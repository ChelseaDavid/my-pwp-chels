	<h1>Personal Website Wireframe and Content Strategy</h1>

	<h3>Content Strategy</h3>
	<!-- Content Strategy -->
	<p>For my content strategy my site will be simple. less is less.</p>
	<!-- Welcome Section -->
		<h4>Welcome section</h4>
			I plan to have an image similar to the one uploaded as my "welcome image".</li>
	<!-- About Me -->
		<h4>About me</h4>
		<p>All information and about me section will be in plain white background with standard text</p>
		<!-- Background color scheme -->
		<p>Between information sections I will have different colored background sections that will divide each group
			and keep with color scheme of welcome image</p>
		<!-- Languages and skills -->
		<h4>Languages and Skill</h4>
		<p>The languages and skills section will have two features. Both icons representing the languages I have learned<br>
			as well as a detailed section listing professional skills, and personality traits that help market me to a possible future employer.</p>>
		<!-- Contact Me -->
		<h4>Contact Me</h4>
		<p>The contact me section will be colored in keeping with the color scheme. though being that the section will be entirely
			color, it will need to be subtle.</p>
		<!-- Headers & Footer -->
		<p>And finally I would like to have a constant menu header AND contact icons footer<br>
			as to always have information available anywhere in the page.</p>
