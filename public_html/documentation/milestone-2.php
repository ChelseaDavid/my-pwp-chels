	<h1>Personal Website Wireframe and Content Strategy</h1>

	<h3>Content Strategy</h3>
	<!-- Content Strategy -->
	<p>For my content strategy my site will be simple. less is less. I plan to have an image similar to the one<br>
		uploaded as my "welcome image".   All information sections will be in plain white background with standard text<br>
		and between information sections I will have different colored background sections that will divide each group<br>
		and keep with color scheme of welcome image,<br>
		The languages and skills section will have two features. both icons representing the languages i have learned and<br>
		a detailed section listing professional skills personality traits that help market me to a possible future employer.<br>
		The contact me section will be colored in keeping with the color scheme. though being that the section will be entirely<br>
		color, it will need to be subtle. And finally i would like to have a constant menu header AND contact icons footer<br>
		as to always have information available anywhere in the page.
	</p>
